## Overview

[OpenAI](https://openai.com/), an AI research organization focused on creating friendly AI for humanity, offers the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) to access its powerful AI models for tasks like natural language processing and image generation.

The `ballarinax/openai-audio` package offers APIs to connect and interact with [Audio related endpoints of OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/create) providing access to the new DALL.E models developed by OpenAI for various audio-related tasks.

## Setup guide

To use the OpenAI Connector, you must have access to the OpenAI API through a [OpenAI Platform account](https://platform.openai.com) and a project under it. If you do not have a OpenAI Platform account, you can sign up for one [here](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
